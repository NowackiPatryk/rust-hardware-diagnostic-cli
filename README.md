### IN PROGRESS

## Simple hardware diagnostic cli. Created mainly to befriend with Rust programming language.

# To run cli you'll need to have cargo installed.

From project root folder run:
```
  cargo run <command>
```

# Availiable commands:
 * `temp` - Shows current, minimum and maxium temperature of hardware components in real time.
 * `cpuinfo` - Shows cpu usage and frequency in real time.
 * `cpubenchmark` - Quick and simple cpu benchmark. Show final score at the end.
